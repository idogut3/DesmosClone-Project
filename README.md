# A Little about the project

This is a project I have been working for one month without prior knowledge in android development. I created this project as part of the extra 5 units for the israeli bagrot program in computer science.
The purpose of the project is to provide an intuitive and efficient tool for plotting polynomial functions.
It aims to help users visualize complex mathematical concepts, making it easier to understand and analyze the behavior of polynomials. This app is designed to be a valuable resource for students, educators, and anyone with an interest in mathematics.
